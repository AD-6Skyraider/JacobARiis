    <h1>Jacob A. Riis: Jake's Place for Help and Healing</h1>
    <h3>Resources in Bowling Green and Warren Co. KY for those in or facing homelessness (and other aid).</h3>
    <H2>I pictured these circles offset and slightly overlapping. Like a Venn Diagram.</H2>

<span class="dot"> This image and header will be a link for HOMELESS SHELTERS</span>
<span class="dot">This image and header will be a link for FOOD BANKS</span>
<span class="dot">This image and header will be a link for DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESOURCES.</span>
<h3>These smaller circles could be for About Us and / or maybe "Other Resources" - Also offset. </h3>
<h2>I would like to add a page for who Jacob A. Riis is. Since I'm sure that will come up. Also, perhaps a subscript somewhere 9not hidden) with a basic pronunciation of Riis. By the way, it's like Reese as in Reese's Pieces.
